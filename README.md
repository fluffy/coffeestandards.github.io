title: Coffee Standards Submissions
---

We happily take pull requests on
[github](http://github.com/CoffeeStandards/CoffeeStandards.github.io).

Only exceptional coffee will be added; we're looking for something
special, whether it be high quality espresso, cold pour, or something
entirely different.

Listings are just a name and a link, up to four descriptive words (no more),
and optionally any of the listed symbols.

Self-promotion from owners will result in a permanent ban. 

All submissions are made under the same license as Coffee Standards.
